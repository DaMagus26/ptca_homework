# Telegarm bot
Telegram bot, that solves task of placing N queens on N by N chess board.

---

This bot as created as a part of my assignment in "Automata theory". The bot is able to tell about itself and about task it solves (in Russian) 
and provides visual solution to the following problem:

> How to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chess board, so they do not attack each other.

Later I expanded capabilities of the bot. Now it can solve the task for N queens of NxN chess board and tell, how many different solutions there are. 
Additionally, it provides GIF-animation, that visualizes the algorithm for one random solution.
